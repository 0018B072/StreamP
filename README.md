# StreamP

To add/edit links, just go to "streams" file (must add a file named "streams") and type: "start YOURLINK" (each has to be in a new line)
Pressing 5 will open a random stream from your list
Pressing 6 will quit the program
The "streams" file must be in the same directory/path as the executable file (xqcProject.exe) (personally, i would put both in a folder)

Here's a screen capture of what to do:

(reopen the program after you add the streams file)
Side Note: I opened the google drive (exe files aren't usually stored in google drives) and 
when it downloads you have to turn off firewalls because it recognizes an exe files as a virus (it's what google does). 
When you download it, add a notepad document named "streams" and do the "start YOURLINK" on each line.
Not sure why simple code/exe files triggers a firewall but ig you have to turn it off. The exe file/program was made in Visual Studio too.
