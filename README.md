# StreamP

To add/edit links, just go to "streams" file (must add a file named "streams") and type: "start YOURLINK" (each has to be in a new line)
Pressing 5 will open a random stream from your list
Pressing 6 will quit the program
The "streams" file must be in the same directory/path as the executable file (xqcProject.exe)
